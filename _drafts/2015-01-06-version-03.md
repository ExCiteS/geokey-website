## How to update

We updated the dependencies to the latest versions, so updating requires a bit fiddling.

First update the dependencies:

```
sudo pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```

Django 1.7.x does not require South for database migrations any longer. Therefore, we need to migrate the database to the Django's native migrations.

```
pyhton manage.py migrate
```

(Fake migrations are required for a number of packages)



We updateted the OAuth library to oauth-toolkit. Apps will be removed
