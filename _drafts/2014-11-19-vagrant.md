While developing GeoKey we fell in love with [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) because it simplified the way we setup and share development environments. We now created Vagrant box that you can use to setup your development environment in less than ten minutes. Here's you can use it:

First clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/excites/geokey
```

Second, in the directory `core/settings`, copy the file `project.sample.py` to `project.py`. Open `project.py` in your text editor and change the database settings:

```
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        ...
        'USER': 'django',
        'PASSWORD': 'django123',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        ...
    }
}
```

Third, fire up the Vagrant VM:

```
vagrant up
```

Fourth, log into the VM via ssh:

```
vagrant ssh
```

Fifth, move to the shared directory and run the tests, to see if things work out:

```
cd /vagrant/
python manage.py test --nocapture --nologcapture
```

Sixth, if all went well, run the test server:

```
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

You now should be able to access the admin interface from your browser via [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

You have now successfully set up a self contained development environemnt.

To shut down the VM and save its state use:

```
vagrant halt
```

And to restart it again use:

```
vagrant up
```
