We are happy to announce the next release of GeoKey today.

### Improvements

- Each category now has ability to set an expiry field, that is used by contributions to set the date (and time) when it should be not available to the public anymore. An expiry field can always be changed or removed as a setting - none of the data is deleted.
- Public API endpoint for getting GeoKey information now includes all extensions added, even those that are installed for use by superusers only. This allows front-ends to decide what functionality can be used if it relies on some extensions.

### How to update

Follow the [update guide](/help/how-to-update.html) to update GeoKey to version 1.1.
