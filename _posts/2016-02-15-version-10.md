We are happy to announce the next release of GeoKey today.

### Improvements

- KML renderer has now possibility to show associated media files and comments. It also correctly visualises values for single and multiple lookups (instead of displaying only IDs).
- New app settings allow to add Google Analytics tracking ID (see example settings for an example).

### Bugfixes

- [#339](https://github.com/ExCiteS/geokey/issues/339): 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get' 

### How to update

Follow the [update guide](/help/how-to-update.html) to update GeoKey to version 0.10.
