Just in time for the Christmas holidays, we released [version 0.2.2](https://github.com/ExCiteS/geokey/releases/tag/0.2.2), which fixes some minor bugs.

Give the new version go on our [test server](http://play.geokey.org.uk/) and [let us know](https://twitter.com/geokey_project) what you think. We see you all in the next year with exiting new features.
