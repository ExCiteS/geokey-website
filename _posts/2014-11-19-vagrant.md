While developing GeoKey we fell in love with [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) because it simplified the way we setup and share development environments. With Vagrant we were able to deploy a complete development environment in less then ten minutes.

We created and released a Vagrant box that you can use to setup your development environment in less than ten minutes. The box is available from our [Vagrant Cloud](https://vagrantcloud.com/excites/boxes/geokey-debian); read [the tutorial](/help/vagrant.html) on how to use it.
