We are happy to announce the next release of GeoKey today. This release includes improvements and upgrades to existing features as well as a few bug fixes.

### Improvements

- All dependencies have been upgraded, except for Django. We continue using v1.8, which is a long-term support version.
- GeoKey extensions can now register their version and GeoKey displays this in the admin pages (together with [Matthias](https://github.com/mstevens83))
- Added ability to lock projects, which will then restricts further editing of a structure of a project.
- Added support for audio files as [documents](/docs/web/document-add.html) (big thanks to [Matthias](https://github.com/mstevens83))
- Lookup values for select boxes and multiple selects can now have images assigned to them.
- Various fixes and improvements on admin templates.
