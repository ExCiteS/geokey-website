We are happy to announce the next release of GeoKey today. This release introduces subsets and improvements to existing features.

### Subsets

Subsets allow you to predefine views on data in a project based on a set of filters. Similar to [the way you define what data a user group can access](/help/granting-permissions-to-usergroups.html), you can select contributions based on categories or attribute values.

Subsets are applied on [contributions API endpoint](http://geokey.org.uk/docs/web/contribution-search.html):

```
GET /api/projects/:project_id/contributions/?subset={subset_id}
```

The subset ID is provided via the [project details](http://geokey.org.uk/docs/web/project-single.html).

Alongside implementing subsets we got rid of the separate endpoint for searching contributions. Instead, just like subsets, you can submit a search query by adding the query parameter to your request:

```
GET /api/projects/:project_id/contributions/?search={query_term}
```

Both subsets and search parameters can be combined, so you can search across subsets.


### Redesign of project navigation

The main navigation through projects has been redesigned to simplify management of projects. You'll find all the important links on top of the page now.
