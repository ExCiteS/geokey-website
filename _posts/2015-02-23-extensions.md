In [version 0.3](/blog/2015/version-03.html) we introduced a hook for custom
extensions into GeoKey that allows you to add bespoke functionality to GeoKey.
This can be special API endpoints for an existing client application,
scripts for data import or additional administration panels to organise and manage
your projects.

 We have now released a
[boilerplate](https://github.com/ExCiteS/geokey-extension-boilerplate) that
you can use to build your own extension for GeoKey along with a
[guide](/help/how-to-create-an-extension.html)
about how to use the boilerplate and start developing.
