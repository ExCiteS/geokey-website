We are happy to officially announce the EpiCollect extension for GeoKey. [EpiCollect](http://www.epicollect.net/) is a mobile and web application to collect data using bespoke forms. This extension allows you to use EpiCollect's mobile client to collect data for GeoKey.

You can [install](/help/ext-epicollect-install.html) EpiCollect for GeoKey within minutes and [start collecting data](/help/ext-epicollect-use.html) now.

This is is the first of several extensions we will be releasing in the coming
months. The new extensions will address GeoKey's biggest shortcoming: The lack of client applications to collect, visualise and analyse data. We designed GeoKey as a data infrastructure for all kinds of participatory mapping platforms. Therefore, provides only the back-end along with  the means set-up and manage projects as well as storing and retrieving data via an open API.

Do you have a client application you want to connect with GeoKey? [Learn how to use the API](/docs/) or [build your own extension](/blog/2015/extensions.html) if you need more bespoke functionality.
