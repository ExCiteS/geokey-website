Now that you have [created the category](how-to-setup-categories.html), you may want to add fields to it. Fields define what information you want to collect for the category. For the category _Restaurant_ you might want to store a name, an address, the number of seats and which couisine they serve. 

On the category overview page, you can start adding a new field by clicking _Create new field_.

You will be redirected to the form to create a new field. Provide a name for the field and a description if neccessary.

Next, you select if your contributors are required to add a value for the field. If you choose to tick the box, users will have to provide a value for the field. Otherwise they will be able to leave the field empty.

Finally, select the type of data this field represents. The name is simply text, so we select _Text_.

After saving the new field you either change the [settings of the field](field-settings.html) or add another field by clicking on the link on the success message on top of the page.

### Adding more fields

In the same way you have just created the field _Name_ for your category _Restaurant_, you create all other fields. The _Address_ would be a text field as well, while _number of seats_ would be a numeric field, obviously.

The field _cuisine_ could be a select box. Select boxes allow users to select an entry from a pre-defined set of values. Let say, you want to map Italian, British, French and German restaurants, then you create a select box with these values. After you have created a field of type _Select box_, you can add and remove accepted values in the field settings page.

To add a new value enter its name in the field below the list and click _Add_. To remove a value click _Remove_ next to the value.
