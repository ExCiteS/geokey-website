Whether you want to map the favourite places in your city or places in your neighbourhood that need improvement — we created a straightforward interface to setup and manage projects. 

Getting a new project up and running is easy. Start by selecting *Create new project* on the dashboard.

Then choose a meaningful name for your project and provide a description, which briefly outlines what your project is about. 

### Choosing the project visibility 

Next, you need to decide who gets access to your project.

Choose *Private* if you want to restrict access to your a selected group of users. Private projects are accessible to project administrators and members of user groups assigned to the project. You can setup and manage user groups after you created the project.

Choose *Public* if you want your project to be publicly available. User, who want to access your data, do not have to be signed in to view your maps.

### Choosing the project permissions

Next you decide who should be able to contribute data to your project.

If you select *Every user can contribute*, all users who have access to the project will be allowed to also contribute data. If your project is public, all users — even those who haven’t signed in — will be able to add data. To private project, all members of any user group can contribute data to your project. 

If you select *Only members of contributor groups can cantribute*, only users, who are members of any user group that has contributor permissions, can contribute to the project.

Finally, click *Save* to create your project. You will then end at your project’s home page. Start here to set up and manage Categories, Data groupings, user groups.
