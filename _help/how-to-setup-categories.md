title:  "How to setup categories for data collection"
---

Now that we have [created a new project](how-to-create-project.html), we want to setup categories and their fields for data collection. Categories help us to define what kind of data is being collected and what kind of information a contributer needs to provide. Based on categories clients create forms for data collection and the provided input is validated before it appears on the map.

We start adding categories by selecting the _Catgories_ from the menu on left-hand side of the project home page.

You will be redirected to the categories overview page. Here you will see all categories that have been created for that project. To add new category, click on _Create new category_. 

To create a category, you have to fill in the following form. First, provide a name for your category, for example _Restaurants_ and an optional description. 

Then, you need to select the default status for contributions of this category. The defaults status determinates, what happens to a new contribution when its saved to the database. If you select *Pending*, then a moderator of the project needs to approve the contribution before it will appear on the map. If you select *Active*on the other hand, the contribution will be visible on the map straight away -- no need for moderation.

Finally click *Save* to create the category. You will be redirected to the category overview page. Form here you can change the set up of the category, e.g. [adding fields](how-to-create-field.html), change [how contributions of this category should be displayed on the map](category-display.html) or change the [general settings](category-settings.html) of the category. You can use the menu on the left-hand side to navigation to the different parts.
