### Adding users

Adding users is straightforward. First navigate to the user group page. You should see an overview of all members already added to the user group.

To add a user to the user group, type their name into the text box in the top left corner. A list appears that shows user names that match the name you entered; click on the name of the user to add the user to your group.
