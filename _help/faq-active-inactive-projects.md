### Active projects

Active projects are visibile, their data can be viewed and new data can be contributed.

### Archived projects

An archived project is not visible to any-one, except project administrators in the admin backend. User are not able to contribute new data or access previously contributed data. 

If you archive a project, all data and settings will be kept, so you can easily activate the project again.
