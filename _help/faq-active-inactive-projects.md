### Active projects

Active projects are visibile, their data can be viewed and new data can be contributed.

### Inactive projects

An inactive project is not visible to anyone, except project administrators in the admin backend. User are not able to contribute new data or access previously contributed data. 

If you make a project inactive, all data and settings will be kept, so you can easily make the project active again.
