### Active categories and fields

Active categories and fields can be used for data contribution. Contributied data will be validated against them.

### Inactive categories and fields

When you make a category or field inactive, they can no longer be used for data contribution. However, data contributed before you made a category or field inactive will still be accessible on your maps.
