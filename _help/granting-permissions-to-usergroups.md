Granting permissions to user groups is two-fold:

1. Defining the role within the project.
2. Granting access to data groupings.

### Defining the role within the project

There are three different roles you can hand to user groups and hence the members of user groups.

- **Read-only:** Members can only read data. They are not able contribute data. However, members of a read-only user group can comment on contributions they can view.
- **Contributor:** Members of the user group will be able to view contribute and comment on data. They are able to edit and delete data they contributed themselves.
- **Moderator:** Moderators are able to view contribute and comment on data. In addition they can approve pending contributions for display on the map as well as edit and delete data.

The roles are set for the whole project, independent of the data the members of the user group can access.

#### Everyone contributes

If you have set up your project so that every user, who has access to the project, can contribute data, it will affect the roles you have given to idividual user groups. Even if you set a user group to read-only, their members will still be able to contribute data. If you wish to restrict who can contribute, you have the change the general settings first.

### Granting access to data groupings

You can define which user groups can access which subsets of the data by granting them access to data groupings. Data groupings provide access to a subset of all data contributed to a project. Hence, by granting user groups access to data groupings, you can define what data its members will be able to view or moderate.

Granting access to user groups is straightforward. When editing the permissions for a user group, click the buttons next to the data grouping name to grant or revoke access to that user group.

#### Data groupings in public projects

If your project is public, you can make data groupings public, too. In fact, by default, all data groupings are public at first. That means, all data groupings can be viewed by anyone.

You can hide a data grouping from the public by navigation to the data grouping settings and revoke access from the public.
