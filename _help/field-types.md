Fields define what information you want your contributors to collect. On this page, we provide an overview of data types that are availbe for fields and when to use them. 

### Text

Text fields should be used for simple text inputs, such as name, an address or a description.

### Numeric

Use numeric fields to collect numbers. For a numeric field, you can also define a minimum and maximum value, which need to be matched when contributing data.

### Date and Time

To collect information about date and time use Date and Time. Contributors can provide a date only or a combination of date and time.

### Select box

Use select boxes when you want to provide contributors with a list of pre-defined values. Contributors can then select one of the values from that list. For example, a list of countries in Europe can be defined as a select box.
